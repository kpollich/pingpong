Welcome to the Clipper Ping Pong tracker! This is a small demo web application for tracking table
tennis matches. To get started, create a player for yourself. You'l be able to add matches with other
players and view your overall record, as well as individual match/game statistics.

We also have a small REST API, accessible through the `/api`/ scope. All endpoints require basic
authentication, so you'll need to create a player to authenticate to the API. This API complies with
the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) standard. See the wiki for more info.
